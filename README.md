    This activity provides an example of how to install the Tableau Server Client.  Once installed, activity illustrates how to connect and submit requests using the site id and personal access token.  Requested information includes workbook name, id and url.  Requests are also made to save a pdf copy of the workbook from the server to a specified location on the local machine.  Additional requests are made to create separate pdfs for each worksheet of the given workbook.
